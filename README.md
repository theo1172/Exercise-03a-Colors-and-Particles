# Exercise-03a-Colors-and-Particles

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A demonstration of this exercise is available at [https://youtu.be/t6AFCsJlIok](https://youtu.be/t6AFCsJlIok)

This exercise is the first opportunity for you to experiment with juicy features to our brick-breaker game. The exercise will provide you with several features that should move you towards the implementation of Project 03.

The expectations for this exercise are that you will

 - [ ] Fork and clone this repository
 - [ ] Import the project into Godot
 - [ ] Replace the ball and paddle with sprites downloaded from kenney.nl. Briefly highlight the ball and paddle when a collision occurs. Briefly flash the walls red if they are hit.
 - [ ] Create a theme for the UI elements. Apply that theme to the menus and the HUD
 - [ ] Color the bricks based on their point value
 - [ ] Add a particle emitter to the paddle and bricks. Emit their respective particles when they experience a collision
 - [ ] Edit the LICENSE and README.md
 - [ ] Commit and push your changes back to GitHub. Turn in the URL of your repository on Canvas.

## Instructions

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-03a-Colors-and-Particles. *Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220 with your full name.* Commit your changes.

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Allow the browser to open (or install) GitHub Desktop. Once GitHub Desktop has loaded, you should see a window labeled "Clone a Repository" asking you for a Local Path on your computer where the project should be copied. Choose a location; make sure the Local Path ends with "Exercise-03a-Colors-and-Particles" and then press the "Clone" button. GitHub Desktop will now download a copy of the repository to the location you indicated.

Open Godot. In the Project Manager, tap the "Import" button. Tap "Browse" and navigate to the repository folder. Select the project.godot file and tap "Open".

If you run the project, you will see a main menu followed by a simple brick-breaker game. We will now have an opportunity to start making it "juicier".

## Downloading Assets and collisions

Download the [Puzzle Pack from Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/puzzle-pack). Unzip it, and then copy the following images from the png folder into `res://Assets/`:
 * ballBlue.png
 * ballGrey.png
 * paddleBlu.png
 * paddleRed.png

Open `res://Ball/Ball.tscn`. Delete the ColorRect node, and create two Sprite nodes as a child of Ball. Name the second Sprite node "Highlight". Set the Texture of the Sprite node to `res://Assets/ballGrey.png` and set the Texture of the Highlight node to `res://Assets/ballBlue.png`. Select the Highlight node, and in the Inspector->CanvasItem->Modulate, set the A value to 0.

After the ball hits an object, we want the blue ball to show up temporarily. We do that by setting `$Highlight.modulate.a = 1.0` and then slowly reducing it back to zero. The best place to decay the alpha value is probably in `_integrate_forces`:
```
	if $Highlight.modulate.a > 0:
		$Highlight.modulate.a -= decay
```

Now, open `res://Paddle/Paddle.tscn`. Repeat the same process as with the ball, except use `res://Assests/paddleRed.png` for the Sprite and `res://Assets/paddleBlu.png` for the Highlight. Because of how the paddle is situationed, both paddles will need to be positioned at (50,10).

After the paddle has been hit, we should also make the paddle's Highlight visible: `$Highlight.modulate.a = 1.0`. The alpha decay can be appended to `_physics_process`:
```
	if $Highlight.modulate.a > 0:
		$Highlight.modulate.a -= decay
```

If the ball hits the walls, we want them to flash red. This will be similar to our work with the sprites, except we will be manipulating the colors directly. In `res://Wall/Wall.gd`, if the wall is hit, set `$ColorRect.color = Color8(201,42,42)`. Then, in `_physics_process`, reduce the saturation and increase the value until it is white again:
```
 	if $ColorRect.color.s > 0:
		$ColorRect.color.s -= decay
	if $ColorRect.color.v < 1:
		$ColorRect.color.v += decay
```

## Create a Theme

Download and unzip the following typefaces from The League of Movable Type:
 * [League Gothic](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic)
 * [Orbitron](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/orbitron)

Once they have been downloaded and unzipped, copy `static/TTF/LeagueGothic-Regular.ttf` and `Orbitron Black.ttf` to `res://Assets`.

Now comes the monotonous process (sorry!) of setting up a UI theme. Open `res://UI/Main_Menu.tscn` and select the Main_Menu node. In the Inspector, select Theme->Theme = New Theme.

Using the eyedropper tool, select the label, and add a new DynamicFont. Edit that resource so that the theme uses `res://LeagueGothic-Regular.ttf` with a Size of 22.

Then, select the Button and create a new StyleBoxFlat for the normal button mode. Update the following properties:
 * BG Color = #1864ab
 * Border Width = (3,3,3,3)
 * Border->Color = #228be6
 * Corner Radius = (20,20,20,20)

Then, copy the StyleBoxFlat from the normal mode and paste it into the other modes: disabled, focus, hover, pressed. After pasting them, *make sure you select Make Uniquie for each one*.

Edit disabled:
 * BG Color = #868e96
 * Border->Color = #495057
 * Color->font_color_disabled = #495057

Edit focus:
 * Border->Color = #74c0fc

Edit hover:
 * Border->Color = #74c0fc

Edit pressed:
 * BG Color = #228be6

Save the theme as `res://UI/UI.tres`

For each of the UI scenes: `res://UI/End_Game.tscn`, `res://UI/Instructions.tscn`, `res://UI/Main_Menu.tscn`, `res://UI/Pause_Menu.tscn`, load `res://UI/UI.tres` as the theme for the root Control node. 

For the Label in `res://UI/Main_Menu.tscn`, override the font to use size=45. Save that font as `res://UI/Title.tres`. Load that for the title lables in `res://UI/End_Game.tscn`, `res://UI/Instructions.tscn`, `res://UI/Main_Menu.tscn`, and `res://UI/Pause_Menu.tscn`.

For `res://UI/HUD.tscn`, use `res://Assets/Orbitron Black.ttf` with size 16 for the Score and Time labels.

## Colors

Now, we want to procedurally color the bricks, depending on their score values. Look up the following [Open Color values](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/ingredients.html) and in `res://Brick/Brick.gd`, in the `_ready` callback, set the color based on the score value:
 * less than 40: Grey 6
 * greater than or equal to 40: Grape 6
 * greater than or equal to 50: Violet 5
 * greater than or equal to 60: Blue 6
 * greater than or equal to 70: Lime 5
 * greater than or equal to 80: Yellow 4
 * greater than or equal to 90: Orange 5
 * greater than or equal to 100: Red 8

The red and orange statements should look like this:
```
	if score >= 100:
		$ColorRect.color = Color8(224,49,49)
	elif score >= 90:
		$ColorRect.color = Color8(253,126,20)
```
## Particles

Finally, open `res://Paddle/Paddle.tscn`, and, as a child of Paddle, add a CPUParticles2d node. Rename it "Confetti". Position it at (50,-10), and set these properties in the Inspector for that particle emitter:
 * Amount = 6
 * Time->Lifetime = 0.5
 * Time->One Shot = On
 * Time->Explosiveness = 0.7
 * Time->Randomness = 1
 * Drawing->Local Coords->Off
 * Drawing->Texture = `res://Assets/confetti.png`
 * Direction->Direction = (0,-1)
 * Direction->Spread = 25
 * Initial Velocity->Velocity = 250
 * Initial Velocity->Velocity Random = 0.6
 * Angular Velocity->Velocity = 800
 * Angular Velocity->Velocity Random = 1
 * Scale->Scale Amount Curve = New Curve
   * Set points for the curve at 1 and 0.3, so it smoothly decreases
 * Color->Color Ramp = New Gradient
   * Set the Gradient so it is opaque white (255,255,255,255) on the left side and completely transparent (255,255,255,0) on the right side
 * Hue Variation->Variation = 1
 * Hue Variation->Variation Random = 1

In `res://Paddle/Paddle.gd`, after the paddle has been hit, set `$Confetti.emitting = true`

We will, likewise, add a particle emitter to `res://Brick/Brick.tscn`. As a child of Brick, add a CPUParticles2d node. Rename it "Confetti". Position it at (45,15), and set these properties in the Inspector for that particle emitter:
 * Amount = 15
 * Time->Lifetime = 0.4
 * Time->One Shot = On
 * Time->Explosiveness = 0.5
 * Drawing->Texture = `res://Assets/bubble.png`
 * Emission Shape->Shape = Rectangle
 * Emission Shape->Rect Extents = (45,15)
 * Direction->Direction = (0,0)
 * Direction->Spread = 180
 * Gravity->Gravity
